                <p>We are excited to share our love of essential oils with you.  When we were first introduced to essential oils, we were struggling with staying healthy and suffering from occasional aches and pains. We were intrigued by the idea of using something natural to stay healthier and were excited to see what essential oils could do for our family.</p> 
            <p>
            Now that we’ve been using essential oils, we can’t imagine life without them.  Our overall health has improved and we find ourselves staying healthier longer.  We are thrilled with the changes that using essential oils have brought into our life.
            </p>
             <p>
                 We are also grateful for the incredible business opportunities that have been ours as a result of being a part of dōTERRA.  We have loved attending retreats and conventions where we’ve learned from scholars, scientists, and doctors who are using doTERRA essential oils in their research and in their practices.
             </p>

We have also been inspired by incredible people like <a href="http://kyle-maynard.com" target="_blank">Kyle Maynard</a>, <a href="http://www.brainline.org/content/2010/01/miles-to-go-before-i-sleep_pageall.html" target="_blank">Jackie Pflug</a>, <a href="http://www.susanershler.com/press.html" target="_blank">Susan Ershler</a>, and <a href="http://www.oprah.com/spirit/Blogger-Stephanie-Nielson-Survives-Plane-Crash" target="_blank">Stephanie Nielson</a>. Another amazing gift that we’ve gained from being a part of dōTERRA is the incredible friendships that we’ve developed with people from all over the world.

                <p>

We hope you are intrigued by what you see and look forward to helping you start your own journey to greater health and abundance.  </p>

                    <img src="images/mint.jpg" alt="Picture of mint leaves" class="right textimage" />
                    <p class="clearfix">Have you ever taken a peppermint leaf and rubbed it in between your fingers?  The beautiful aroma that you smell comes from the essential oils found on the plant.  Essential oils are the volatile aromatic compounds found in the leaves, stem, bark or flowers of a plant.   Essential oils  not only play an important role in protecting the plant, they also play a role in supporting healthy body systems.</p>

                    <p>The same holds true with essential oils.  Plants that are grown and harvested in the proper regions and at the right time will produce a higher quality of essential oil.

                   <p> <a href="http://doterra.com" target="_blank">dōTERRA International</a> was founded in January 2008 by an incredible team of industry executives who had a vision of “revolutionizing the way families manage their health.”</p>  

<p>dōTERRA’s executive team understood that certain products, like essential oils,  became more valuable when connected with a personal experience.  Because of this, dōTERRA’s essential oil are sold exclusively through Independent Wellness Advocates who introduce, educate and sell dōTERRA products.</p>

<p>Within 7 years, dōTERRA reached $1 Billion in sales and continues to flourish in the United States and internationally.  </p>

<p>There are two types of business opportunities in dōTERRA.  The first opportunity comes through simply sharing your oil experiences with family and friends.  Hosting an in-home event is a great way to accomplish this.  When you share, you have the opportunity to earn commissions from the purchased products.  This is a fun and easy way to earn enough money to pay for the cost of your essential oils and to make a little extra money on the side.
</p>

<p>The second opportunity is to build an incredible business.  It takes generosity, dedication, and hard work to run a successful business.  The same holds true with dōTERRA.  If you have ever dreamed of owning your own business, or simply want to earn some extra income, then please contact us.  We are dedicated to helping you accomplish your goals.</p>
