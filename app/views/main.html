<h2 class="brand">Welcome!</h2>
	<p>We are so excited for the fun and incredible experiences that each of you will get to experience this month as you take the time to Share Big! As you start this challenge, we hope that you will reflect upon how your life has changed since youâ€™ve started using essential oils and the gratitude you feel toward the person who took time to share these precious gifts with you. </p>

<p>We know that as you share the oils with others, that they will be equally grateful to you for taking time to help make their lives better. So cast your fears aside and be bold in sharing, someone will be ever so grateful that you did. </p>
